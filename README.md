# Mareanie and Toxapex Model Pack!

This is a resource/data pack that includes my complete model set of Mareanie and Toxapex! Mareanie is one of my favorite pokemon and I would love to see it soon in Cobblemon! It's a very adorable starfish that is very tanky in PVP. Also a great counter to setup pokemon!

## Pack Features include:
- Animations ( Idle, Swimming, Walking, Fainting, Sleeping, Blinking, and Cries)
- Correct scaling to the portrait and profile pictures!
- Spawn Data: Set to spawn in warm oceans anytime near live coral blocks!
- New Shoulder Pokemon: Mareanie can ride on your shoulder!

This model pack is free to use and edit!
